Here is a brief overview of my work and interests. 
I am interested in building AI systems that can reason but that are also safe and fair.

## Research

I was lucky enough to see my work published in top-tier conferences ([ICML](https://openreview.net/forum?id=CmOmaxkt8p){:target="_blank"}, [ICLR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gT5hALch9z){:target="_blank"}, [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4594/4472){:target="_blank"}, 
[ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.154.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [NAACL](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.348/){:target="_blank"}, [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02504-3){:target="_blank"}).
  Some of my work has been featured in press ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00674-9){:target="_blank"}, [Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00631-7){:target="_blank"}, [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-generated-images-bias-racism-sexism-stereotypes/){:target="_blank"}). 

I am an Editor for the Neuro-symbolic AI journal and an Action Editor for the ACL Rolling Review.
