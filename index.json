Several NLP methods have been proposed to classify texts as truthful or deceptive. In most cases, however, the target texts' preceding context is not considered. This is a severe limitation, as any communication takes place in context, not in a vacuum, and context can help to detect deception. We study a corpus of Italian dialogues containing deceptive statements and implement deep neural models that incorporate various linguistic contexts. We establish a new state-of-the-art identifying deception and find that not all context is equally useful to the task. Only the texts closest to the target, if from the same speaker (rather than questions by an interlocutor), boost performance. We also find that the semantic information in language models such as BERT contributes to the performance. However, BERT alone does not capture the implicit knowledge of deception cues: its contribution is conditional on the concurrent use of attention to learn cues from BERT's representations.","tags":[],"title":"BERTective: Language Models and Contextual Information for Deception Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Bianchi","Silvia Terragni","Dirk Hovy","Debora Nozza","Elisabetta Fersini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"1aea40578aaeb79054905662a2c0203a","permalink":"https://federicobianchi.io/publication/cross-lingual-contextualized-topic-models-for-zero-shot/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cross-lingual-contextualized-topic-models-for-zero-shot/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a novel topic modeling method that can make use of contextulized embeddings (e.g., BERT) to do zero-shot cross-lingual topic modeling.","tags":["NLP","Topic Modeling","BERT","Language Models"],"title":"Cross-lingual Contextualized Topic Models with Zero-shot Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Bianchi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613566800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613566800,"objectID":"f962e0e4405e52f2de6ccd416d10f4b4","permalink":"https://federicobianchi.io/talk/talk-learning-jax-for-great-good/","publishdate":"2021-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk-learning-jax-for-great-good/","section":"event","summary":"I gave a tutorial on JAX,  the new google framework for deep learning.

The former are transparent and data-efficient, but they are sensitive to noise and cannot be applied to non-symbolic domains where the data is ambiguous. The latter can learn complex tasks from examples, are robust to noise, but are black boxes; require large amounts of –not necessarily easily obtained– data, and are slow to learn and prone to adversarial examples. Either paradigm excels at certain types of problems where the other paradigm performs poorly. In order to develop stronger AI systems, integrated neuro-symbolic systems that combine artificial neural networks and symbolic reasoning are being sought. In this context, one of the fundamental open problems is how to perform logic-based deductive reasoning over knowledge bases by means of trainable artificial neural networks. This paper provides a brief summary of the authors’ recent efforts to bridge the neural and symbolic divide in the context of deep deductive reasoners. Throughout the paper we will discuss strengths and limitations of models in term of accuracy, scalability, transferability, generalizabiliy, speed, and interpretability, and finally, will talk about possible modifications to enhance desirable capabilities. More specifically, in terms of architectures, we are looking at Memory-augmented networks, Logic Tensor Networks, and compositions of LSTM models to explore their capabilities and limitations in conducting deductive reasoning. We are applying these models on Resource Description Framework (RDF), first-order logic, and the description logic EL+ respectively.","tags":[],"title":"Towards bridging the neuro-symbolic gap: deep deductive reasoners.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Bianchi","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Approaches to embed entities, entity types and relations represented in the graph into vector spaces - often referred to as KG embeddings - have become increasingly popular for their ability to capture the similarity between entities and support other reasoning tasks. However, representation of time has received little attention in these approaches. In this work, we make a first step to encode time into vector-based entity representations using a text-based KG embedding model named Typed Entity Embeddings (TEEs). In TEEs, each entity is represented by a vector that represents the entity and its type, which is learned from entity mentions found in a text corpus. Inspired by evidence from cognitive sciences and application-oriented concerns, we propose an approach to encode representations of years into TEEs by aggregating the representations of the entities that occur in event-based descriptions of the years. These representations are used to define two time-aware similarity measures to control the implicit effect of time on entity similarity. Experimental results show that the linear order of years obtained using our model is highly correlated with natural time flow and the effectiveness of the time-aware similarity measure proposed to flatten the time effect on entity similarity","tags":["Semantic Web","NLP","KG","Embeddings"],"title":"Towards Encoding Time in text-based Entity Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Bianchi","Matteo Palmonari","Marco Cremaschi","Elisabetta Fersini"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498953600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498953600,"objectID":"915960b541cbc7136bb0c682f26ac312","permalink":"https://federicobianchi.io/publication/actively-learning-to-rank/","publishdate":"2017-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/actively-learning-to-rank/","section":"publication","summary":"Knowledge Graphs (KG) represent a large amount of Semantic Associations (SAs), i.e., chains of relations that may reveal interesting and unknown connections between different types of entities. Applications for the contextual exploration of KGs help users explore information extracted from a KG, including SAs, while they are reading an input text. Because of the large number of SAs that can be extracted from a text, a first challenge in these applications is to effectively determine which SAs are most interesting to the users, defining a suitable ranking function over SAs. However, since different users may have different interests, an additional challenge is to personalize this ranking function to match individual users’ preferences. In this paper we introduce a novel active learning to rank model to let a user rate small samples of SAs, which are used to iteratively learn a personalized ranking function. Experiments conducted with two data sets show that the approach is able to improve the quality of the ranking function with a limited number of user interactions.","tags":["Semantic Web","NLP","KG"],"title":"Actively Learning to Rank Semantic Associations for Personalized Contextual Exploration of Knowledge Graphs","type":"publication"}]
